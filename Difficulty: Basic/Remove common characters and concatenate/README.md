The task is to <strong>remove</strong> all characters that are <strong>common</strong> in both strings and then <strong>combine</strong> the <strong>remaining characters</strong> from each string to form a new string. The characters that are not shared between the two strings should appear in the result in the <strong>same order</strong> as they appear in their respective original strings. If, after removing the common characters, <strong>no characters</strong> are left to form the result, return "<strong>-1</strong>"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Examples:</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input: </strong>s1 = aacdb, s2 = gafd
<strong>Output: </strong>cbgf<strong>
Explanation: </strong>The common characters of s1 and s2 are: a, d. The uncommon characters of s1 and s2 are c, b, g and f. Thus the modified string with uncommon characters concatenated is cbgf.</span>

<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input: </strong>s1 = abcs, s2 = cxzca
<strong>Output: </strong>bsxz<strong>
